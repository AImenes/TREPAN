# TREPAN
Implementation of the TREPAN algorithm in Python

# The Oracle
The oracle is used for three purposes
    (i) to determine the class labels for the network's training examples; 
    (ii) to select splits for each of the tree's internal nodes; 
    (iii) and to determine if a node covers instances of only one class. These aspect of the algorithm are discussed in more detail below .
